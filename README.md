# Gaia

Gaia is the shared model of the Aporeto plaform.

Most of the Go code is autogenerated (but enum/enum.go). You should **never** edit any model files manually.


## Prerequisites

You need Monolithe and the Elemental plugin to be installed. If not already, run:

    $ make init


## Edit the code

To edit the code, use the Specification Director available here:

    https://ec2-54-186-150-21.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com


## Generate the code

To generate the code, run:

    $ make

Then push to Github. Remember to update the `glide.lock` files for all the projects you want to use the newly generated version.
